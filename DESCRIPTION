Description: Implementation of Sequential BATTing (bootstrapping and aggregating of thresholds from trees) for developing threshold-based multivariate (prognostic/predictive) biomarker signatures. Variable selection is automatically built-in. Final signatures are returned with interaction plots for predictive signatures. Cross-validation performance evaluation and testing dataset results are also output. Detail algorithms are described in Huang et al (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7236>.
